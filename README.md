My album

This is an application, which I created to improve my skills with Django, and possibly a scalable project to 
bring it to production. The main idea is a personal image album, 
where each user can save their images, download them, delete them, all this privately.

This is mainly for you in research mode to learn user authentication and file handling, with the Django framework.


Features

-The application is developed with the Django framework to work its backend.
-In the frontend I use bootstrap and pure css.
-Pure javascript was also used to a lesser extent for some of the image gallery features.
-The database in its development phase is being managed with sqlite, which is the default django database, then in production it will be changed.


Usage

--The application has an authentication system.
-Once registered you can authenticate yourself and through the interface create an album with a specific theme or date, 
then you can upload your images.
-In addition, if you forget your password, you can easily recover it with your email.
-The images saved in your albums can be downloaded whenever you like.
-The images can be seen in the gallery of each album created by the user.
